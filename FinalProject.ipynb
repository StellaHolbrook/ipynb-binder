    "In the future, renewable energy sources will need to become the dominant source of electricity generation in order to curb the effects of climate change Wind Energy is a mean by which people can renewably generate power in the future. A current limitation with wind energy is that it has very low power density compared to other forms of energy generation. Power density in this project is expressed as Watts per square meter. In this project, I will attempt to identify what attributes of wind turbines are correlated with a wind power project's power density. The four independent variables I look at in particular are:\n",
    "\n",
    "The area of the wind project in square meters\n",
    "The rotor diameter of each turbine\n",
    "The number of turbines located in each project\n",
    "The capacity in MW of each project. \n",
    "\n",
    "Two seperate multiple linear regressions will be run to give coefficients for each independent variable that affects the power density for wind projects. Lastly, a calculation using an objective function will be used to calculate the maximum power density possible for an imaginary wind power plant that uses constraints and weights based off coefficients derived from the relationship between power density and the independent variables.

    "### Plotting Data as Part of EDA\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do exciting things such as determining if rotor diameter affects power density, first the user should plot the data in its natural state to see what shape its values make it take. Below, matplot lib pyplot plots were created to do just that. they help the user understand the nature of the data. these preliminary visualizations are from the smaller \"windProjects\" dataframe. This means that 88 points are in each subplot. It will also be important to get a line of best fit for each dataset. A linear line of best fit will follow the equation:\n",
    "                                            \n",
    "                                            Y = Mx + B\n",
    "                                            \n",
    "numpy can be used to create a line of best fit from data on a subplot. Below a line of best fit is drawn from the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "                    plot(np.unique(y1), np.poly1d(np.polyfit(y1, X, 1))(np.unique(y1))\n",
    "                    \n",
    "plot( np.unique( y ), begins this line of code with the plot command. These is a varibale before th e.plot to indicate where this is plotting from. In the first argument of plot, np.unique selects unique values of the array in the unique argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "..., np.poly1d(np.polyfit(y, x, 1))... poly1d is a one dimensional polynomial class, meaning it is also in an array shape. \n",
    "inside this array's argument is np.polyfit() which is used to return a line of best fit that follows a linear equaiton that minimises the least squared error. the x and y inside the np.polyfit() argument are variabels that represent the data thats being plotted. The interger in the third part of the argument is the degree of the polynomial. By increaseing this interger, the line will curve to become closer to the center of the plotted data as it travels along the x axis. \n",
    "\n",
    "...(np.unique( y )) will end this line of code by being in its own level of indentation, this also take unique values of the variable it holds, it is there to give the array that affects the slope of the line. \n"

The other regression only had two indendent variables which were the mean rotor diameter and the square area of each project. These regressions were run seperatly becuase since the values of area are in square meters, each value in this independent variable is huge compared to the values of other variables. the coefficients output from the regression change drastically when they are regressed along with the area in square meters. This also allows for a distinction between an explicitly spatial regression that has units of area in the independent and dependent variables versus a regression where only the dependent variable contain units of area.
